Actually, I had to get up at 5:30 AM to make a brief trip out of town, 
so I'll have to catch up on Sunday morning (and I will!!).

Ian -I have received the funds transfer from PayPal and await the 
invoice from the seller. But don't worry about any other funds until I 
get these in my hands. I'm concerned about the packing of these cells. 
If necessary (and that will probably be the case) I'll repack them for 
the long journey. So when I get them in hand we can finalize the next 
leg of the trip.

It was my pleasure helping you lads. I'm very anxious to see the KiwiSat 
project move smartly forward and will continue to offer my help if and 
when you need it.

Mark - your comments about contacting the seller are noted and I will 
comment on that (after I get the cells in hand).

Since it's the weekend, I may not hear from the seller until Monday, but 
I will be giving you updates as the transaction progresses.

Oh - I have already received an email from someone (maybe another bidder 
on the cells) saying (and I paraphrase) " Geez - you won 200 cells. You 
can't possible use them all. I'm interested in buying a bunch from 
you."  Obviously they are a popular item.

Have a great weekend gents as you start thinking about all the testing 
you'll be doing with the cells.

Very best regards...Bill - N6GHz
