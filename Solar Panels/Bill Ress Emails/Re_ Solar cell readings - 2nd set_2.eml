Aaah! Yes very clear indeed now Fred ---- Thanks.

So I can assume that they went through thermal vacuum O.K. By any 
chance.........did you take before and after thermal vacuum cell data. 
In other words you didn't notice any performance deterioration?? Or is 
that test yet to come?

So it appears that the up shot of the whole effort to date is that these 
cells are winners (considering the going price) and that I'd better keep 
an eye out for him to be selling more.

Nice machining job on the fixture!!

Regards and again thanks for the data...Bill - N6GHz
