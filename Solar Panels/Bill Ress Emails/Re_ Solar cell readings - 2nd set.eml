Hi Fred,

First - thanks for sharing the data!

Second, I think I might have gotten off track following the data. What 
is the physical cell difference between Tecstar 1, 2 and 3 and Tecstar 
4, 5, and 6. I know you thermal vacuum tested a batch which I believe 
are the 6 plus 6 string set tested as1, 2 and 3.  Have the 6 plus 6 set 
in 4, 5 and 6 had the same testing?

One thing I noticed was the difference in optimum the power of the two 6 
cell strings when then are just paralleled. In fact the data shows a 
reduces power output of the parallel string of 6 compared to the optimum 
power point for the individual series string of 6. It's not a great 
deal, but I'm thinking that perhaps there's a better way to combine the 
strings versus simply paralleling them. Or have I missed something??

Keep the data coming. I like data!!

Regards...Bill - N6GHz
