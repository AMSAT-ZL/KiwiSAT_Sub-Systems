Fred...I had good success using a silver/metal cleaner applied with a 
stiff bristle small paint brush followed by paint brush cleaning with 
alcohol and then using a water soluble flux when tinning the tabs with 
solder. With the fragility of the tabs it seems that keeping it a 
"liquid" process was best. But, I'm sure you might find other ways.

Perhaps Graham, David, Howard et. al. have some ideas from the SSETI 
experience.

I like your fixture. Did you just recently machine it?
