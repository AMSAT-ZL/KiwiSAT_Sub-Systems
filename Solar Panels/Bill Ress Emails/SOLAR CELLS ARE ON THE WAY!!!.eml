Hello all,

The solar cells have been sent today via US Priority Mail. I also 
insured the parcel for $600.00 (the declared value). What is GST? Is 
that your import duties? Do you know how much that will be? "EAR99 - No 
License Required" was placed on the customs form. So now we wait 6 to 10 
days!!!

I also took 14 pieces from the small bundle and repacked the remaining 
with cut down index card separators between each one. As noted earlier, 
the shipping costs are payment (donation) for the 14 cells - and that's 
final!

I ran some preliminary tests on the 14 and they are remarkably 
consistent for open circuit Vout compared to some other cells I've 
played with. Once you get a handle on mounting them it appears they 
should work very well.

Mounting them will be interesting. I've started looking into just that 
and will share with you what I find.

Best regards...Bill - N6GHz
