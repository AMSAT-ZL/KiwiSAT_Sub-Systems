Aah - what a relief knowing they arrived safe and sound and ready to 
power your KiwiSat.

I'll sure be interested in knowing how the testing/grading goes and then 
the vacuum testing.

I have a few question for Niel regarding his experiences with the 
Tecstar cells on SSETI and then I'll be off to proceed with testing on 
this end on the cells I kept.

Golly this is fun - isn't it??

I received an email from Chuck Green regarding the connector but he 
couldn't remember the details and suggested I contact Mark at SpaceQuest 
which I have done.

I know you tried to raise him with no luck. We'll see what response I get.

Regards...Bill - N6GHz
