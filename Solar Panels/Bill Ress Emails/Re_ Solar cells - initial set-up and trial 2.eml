Hello all,

Nothing like getting "data." It looks like about 445 mW maximum power at 
1.87 V and 238 mA and 335 mW where I'll be "nominally" using them - 2 
volts (for 62 degrees). That's great since I'll be using 2 cells in 
series per face to charge the primary cells running at 3.6 volts. Aaah - 
looking good!

Thanks for the data and the pixs!! Keep 'em  coming.

I located a distributor for the Continental connectors who is quoting 
about $3.00 a piece but the minimum quantity buy is 100 pieces per part 
number - ouch!

How many do you plan on using???

Regards...Bill - N6GHz
