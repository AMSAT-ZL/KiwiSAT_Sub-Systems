Your work sounds good. My experience, don't put too much faith in the
models, there is always a bit if empirical work too do, especially around
filters. I have a SAW filter at work at the moment that is getting very
upset with a 8dB return loss on its input. Fussy things.

Progress here: The FM TX came back from Salcom with its SMD parts loaded. I
will try to load the rest this week.
Thanks
Kelvin
