Hi All,

Just spoke to Craig Shearer at EMC Ltd here in Lower Hutt. They would be
happy to place this PCB at no charge for labour or for any parts they
already have.

He suggested that the PCB be hand placed and reflow soldered. A stencil
would be necessary - a stainless steel one as the mylar stencils are no
good. But he suggested that an approach to Capital Circuits (in Petone,
Lower Hutt) may get these for nothing also (usually cost $285 or so).

Capital circuits may also be willing to sponsor the PCB manufacturing. They
do up to 4 layer PCBs. I regularly use them.

I suggest that you plan what PCBs need to be done and when and try to
consolidate these onto a single panel as much as possible. In that way we
will only be asking for one panel for the whole thing rather than for each
sub-system. Once you have this sorted I can approach Capital Circuits.

Regards
    Clayton
