Hi Terry,

If Nick is nice enough to offer to do the work tidying up the 
grounds, that will be fine by me !

I have been through the schematic and checked all of the sensitive 
grounds - these are High Q UHF earth returns. I don't think there is 
much point worrying about an extra nH at 21MHz, but certainly no harm 
up at 400MHz.

Anyway, High Q, UHF grounds are as follows: C1, C3, C7, C8, C28, C29, 
C49, C45, C53, C54, C55, C56, C57, C58, C60, also IC2 pin 6, IC2 pin 
8 and TR2 Emitter - that should reduce the work significantly.

I would *really* like to keep the one de-coupling cap on the bottom 
side of the PCB, this is the only really sensitive part around the FM IF IC.

IC4 only has stability capacitors, there are no circulating currents, 
so the layout shouldn't be a problem. However, if Nick wants to re-do 
it, be my guest.

I assume that the overlayed vias messed up the hole count, which 
makes sense. How on earth did he find that !!

And yes, a new set of Gerbers would be great.

I am very grateful for his help and always interested in learning...

Regards,

Mark.
