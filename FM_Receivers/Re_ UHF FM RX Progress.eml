Mark
Well done, at least you got the DB9 connector the right way! I am working my
way though an annoying problem on the FMTX, the first (48MHz) filter tuning
is very touchy, almost suggesting reaction feedback to the oscillator,
causing the tuned circuit Q to be very large. I have seen this before in
similar designs.
FRED - we have the VHF/UHF antennas up in the air ready for the transponder
in Branch05 Christchurch.
Thanks
Kelvin
