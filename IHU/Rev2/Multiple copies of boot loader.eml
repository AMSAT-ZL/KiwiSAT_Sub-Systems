Hi All,

There seems to be quite a bit of support for the idea of
multiple copies of the boot loader.  To avoid completely
the single point of failure in letting the loader code do
the selection, why not expand the hardware scheme already
in place?  U43B is a 1-bit counter; it could be replaced
by a 4-bit counter, then use the outputs to drive 2, 3 or
4 of the high-order ROM address lines.  That would split
the ROM into 4, 8 or 16 pieces, each of which would have
a copy of the loader code.  If the loader decided it was
unable to run for any reason, e.g. failed checksum, it
would just halt and wait for the next reset, which would
cycle the counter to the next copy.

The ROM is 256K bytes, so the loader is given 128K under
the present scheme.  Under the proposed scheme it would
have 64K, 32K or 16K.  I'll have to code up a rough dummy
version to see how it goes, but 16K is probably enough.

Regards,
Austin.
