Subject: IHU IO glitch - the HW fix
Date: Saturday, 29 January 2011 10:47 a.m.

I have made and confirmed the necessary HW change to correct the IO glitch. 
In the process I totally destroyed U51 (it already had a fix since it is Mk1 
PCB, so my fix was not easy - nor did I have the right tools for the job!)
Anyway, I strapped a new device on top of a nearby chip and wired it up. All 
good now. The oscilloscope proves that the mod works as expected.

You will need to do the necessary mod to your IHU, although in many cases 
the glitch will not show itself.
I will document the change needed in the HW description, but the 
modification required is to lift pin 4 of U51 (currently connected to ADDR3) 
and instead connect it to ALE (eg pin 11 of U12;  pin 11 of U14; or pin1 of 
U68).

Get it done by someone who knows what they are doing (i.e. not me - see 
photo!)

Clayton
